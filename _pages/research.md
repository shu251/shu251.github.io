#### **Single-celled microbial eukaryotes / protists / microeuks**
What microbial eukaryotes are present in a marine environment? and what are they doing? These are the motivating questions of my research. Protistan (or microbial eukaryote) species make up the majority of the branches of the eukaryotic tree of life with their diverse physical forms (morphologies) and metabolisms or trophic strategies. 

#### **Ecology of microbial eukaryotes at hydrothermal vents**
Highly reduced and thermally charged venting fluids discharged from the subseafloor mix with surrounding seawater at hydrothermal vents â€“ this creates a sharp geochemical gradient which promotes a hub of biological diversity. While studies of prokaryotic diversity at hydrothermal vent sites have highlighted the important roles microorganisms play in deep sea carbon cycling and offered a unique window into subseafloor microbial communities, depictions of deep-sea marine ecology and food webs are incomplete without characterization of single-celled microbial eukaryotes (protists). I am currently working on culture-independent techniques (tag-sequencing and metatranscriptomics) to provide a thorough understanding of protistan biogeography in and near venting fluids, focusing on the vent fluid-seawater interface. 
  I am specifically focusing on the role of phagotrophic protists at these niche environments. By coupling grazing and RNA-SIP experiments we can hone in on this important trophic interaction. 
Quantifying the role of heterotrophic protists is incredibly important, as these processes form the foundation of deep-sea marine food webs and may mediate a significant amount of carbon transferred to higher trophic levels.

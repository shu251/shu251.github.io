# Introduction to R
[Generating figures](https://github.com/shu251/PreliminaryFigures_V4_tagseq) from HTS tag-sequencing data - OTU or ASV table as input



# Practical Ecology

Resources for time-series analysis: [code and analyses](https://github.com/shu251/18Sdiversity_diel) from [A Hard Day's Night](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmars.2018.00351/full)

# Meta'omics

[Code](https://github.com/shu251/SPOT_metatranscriptome) from [a metatranscriptomic survey of protistan trophic strategies](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1462-2920.14259)
  + [EukZoo](https://zenodo.org/record/1476236#.XRdsuC2ZNTY) database, an aquatic protistan protein database for meta-omics studies

# Amplicon sequence analysis

I am currently working on streamlined pipelines to determine Amplicon Sequence Variants (ASVs) or Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) using **QIIME2** or **DADA2** in R for use in environmental microbial ecology.

## Introduction to tag-sequencing 

[QIIME1](https://github.com/shu251/V4_tagsequencing_18Sdiversity_q1) or 
[QIIME2](https://github.com/shu251/qiime2_ASVworkflow_v8).

## Building reproducible pipeline for amplicon sequence analysis

Implementing a snakemake workflow to make tag-sequencing pipeline more robust [HERE](https://github.com/shu251/tagseq-qiime2-snakemake)
  + [Building/prepping](https://github.com/shu251/db-build-microeuks) a database for use in QIIME2

# Data management
